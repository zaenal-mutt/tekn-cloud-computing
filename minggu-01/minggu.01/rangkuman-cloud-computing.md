Cloud computing
Definition:
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, including data storage and computing power, without the need for direct user management. It relies on shared resources and often follows a pay-as-you-go model.

Five Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing (per NIST):

On-demand self-service: Users can provision computing resources autonomously without human interaction with the service provider.
Broad network access: Capabilities are available over the network and accessible through standard mechanisms.
Resource pooling: Computing resources are pooled and dynamically allocated based on consumer demand.
Rapid elasticity: Resources can be provisioned and released to scale quickly in response to demand.
Measured service: Cloud systems automatically monitor, control, and optimize resource usage, providing transparency to both providers and consumers.
History:
Cloud computing traces its roots back to the 1960s with the concept of time-sharing. The term "cloud" was used in 1994 by General Magic and gained popularity in 1996 with Compaq's business plan. Major developments occurred in the 2000s, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) launching in 2002, Google Docs in 2006, and the emergence of Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, IBM SmartCloud, and Oracle Cloud.

Value Proposition:
Cloud computing offers various benefits, including cost reductions, device and location independence, easier maintenance, multitenancy, improved performance, increased productivity, availability, scalability, and security.

Challenges and Limitations:
Cloud computing faces challenges related to data security and privacy, reduced visibility and control over cloud resources, and the complexity of cloud migration.

Service Models:
Cloud computing is categorized into three main service models:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, to users who manage their operating systems and applications.
Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a development environment to application developers, including an operating system, programming language execution environment, database, and web server.
Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers application software and databases to users via the cloud, eliminating the need for users to manage infrastructure and platform components.

cation with cloud services.

Services: MBaaS platforms offer various services, such as user management, push notifications, social media integration, and more. These services simplify the development process and enhance app functionality.

Cloud Integration: MBaaS seamlessly integrates with cloud storage and computing resources, reducing the complexity of managing infrastructure for app developers.

Recent Development: MBaaS gained prominence relatively recently, with most startups in this space emerging after 2011. However, it has gained traction among enterprises looking to streamline their app development and management.

Serverless Computing (Function-as-a-Service - FaaS):
Serverless computing is another cloud computing model characterized by the following features:

Managed Resources: In serverless computing, the cloud provider manages the allocation and scaling of virtual machines (VMs) automatically in response to application requests. Developers don't need to manage server provisioning.

Billing Model: Serverless platforms charge users based on the actual resources consumed during the execution of functions, rather than a fixed hourly rate for VMs.

Event-Driven: Serverless computing operates on an event-driven model, where functions are triggered by specific events, such as HTTP requests, database updates, or user actions.

FaaS: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a subset of serverless computing, where developers deploy individual functions to the cloud. These functions execute in response to specific events and can be written in various programming languages.

Flexibility: Serverless architectures offer flexibility and cost-effectiveness because users only pay for the compute resources used during execution.

Deployment Models in Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing offers different deployment models, including:

Private Cloud: This model is dedicated to a single organization, providing control and security but requiring significant investment in infrastructure.

Public Cloud: Public cloud services are offered over the internet, allowing multiple customers to share resources. Security concerns exist but can be mitigated.

Hybrid Cloud: Hybrid cloud combines elements of both public and private clouds, offering flexibility and scalability while maintaining control over sensitive data.

Community Cloud: Community cloud is shared among organizations with similar concerns, such as security or compliance requirements.

Distributed Cloud: Distributed clouds involve multiple machines or locations connected over a network, providing scalability and redundancy.

Multi Cloud: Multi-cloud refers to using multiple cloud service providers for different services or applications to reduce reliance on a single vendor.

Poly Cloud: Poly cloud involves using multiple public clouds to leverage specific services from each provider, optimizing functionality.

These deployment models cater to various organizational needs, balancing factors like data security, control, and cost-efficiency.

Other Cloud Computing Concepts:

Big Data: Cloud computing facilitates the storage and analysis of large datasets, enabling applications such as business analytics and geospatial analysis.

HPC (High-Performance Computing) Cloud: HPC cloud provides the computational power needed for resource-intensive tasks and scientific simulations.

Cloud Architecture: Cloud architecture involves the design and organization of cloud systems, emphasizing communication between different cloud components.

Cloud Engineering: Cloud engineering encompasses the systematic development, operation, and maintenance of cloud computing systems, addressing commercialization, standardization, and governance.

Security and Privacy: Cloud computing raises concerns about data security and privacy, and solutions include encryption, identity management, and adherence to privacy policies.

Market: The cloud computing market has seen significant growth, with global spending on cloud services reaching billions of dollars, and this trend is expected to continue.

Similar Concepts: Cloud computing shares characteristics with client-server models, computer bureaus, grid computing, fog computing, utility computing, peer-to-peer networks, and more.
